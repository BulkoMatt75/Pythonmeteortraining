to load python - ipython3
print ("I have " + str(3) + " cats.") 
- will display
I have 3 cats
greeting = "Hello, "
name = "Matt"
greeting + name
displays
'Hello, Matt'
  
in this code Python will check the variable " cart " for an entry from the top display you can see that the cart is empty and it tells us to ' Go Shop!'
Once we have placed something within the variable remit of " cart " i.e. ' food' once the code is ran it then asks if we want to check out.
A clear but simple use of the " else " command.
lists and sentences when counting Python always starts at 0(zero)
so in the list
colors = ["red", "orange"}
the r in red is count 0(zero)
to search backwards use Ctrl+r then enter chosen code and then hit enter
when searching or "splitting" its easier to keep the modifiers short
 
Countdown loops
correct ;
 
Incorrect
 
By removing the - before the = i have created an infinite loop - this can be easily broken out of by using ctrl+c
 
the use of .pop on a lis tis to remove the last item from the list until the list is empty and therefore will return a false statement.
 
To append the list 
names.append("Larry")
 
 
Functions
print("Hello, world!")
Hello, world!
len ("Hello, world")
13
len = the amount of characters, it starts from 0(zero) and includes spaces.
sum = will add the numbers in the list
sum([1,2,3]) this will equal 6
 
max and min work in a similar but will define the maximum / minimum numbers in that list
 
 
range will count and stop before the number given
 
 
Sorted and reversed sorted are 2 ways of putting things into an alphabatised order.
Format and making the code easy to read is the better way to use Python
 
 
 
to copy a list
 
 
here there is a copy of a_list to b_list then and append which added 'Owls' this was then copied to blist and appened to have the word Hacky Sack added.
Creating a function
to create a function use the def command
 
 
greet has become the function and the variable 'name' was defined earlier in the course
 name = ["Matt"]    this defines the name variable.
Always ensure your syntax is correct the two examples below show the differance of worn and right - the correst answer should be 24:
 
The top (incorrect) one has no space between the equals and the number 1.

None and Dictionaries
None = a type of with single value that can be nothing or one value.
 
if the data has no value no return output will be shown, this is reversed if there is value (obv).
Dicts or Dictionairies
For example a dictionary is used to look up phrases rather than words;
 
Dicts are not organised like lists and will not sort;
 
you can use two ways to get the value of the key (key=matt or Bob)
 
.get is a function.
2 ways of showing the data:
 
to show just values:
 
for a list of both key and value data
 
how to delete from a dictionary using del or .pop - .pop can be used to remove from anywhere in the list at anytime
del
 
.pop
 
when the dictionary "cats" is ran each time you can that there is one less key in the dictionary of "cats" each time.
to add back in at anytime just use;
 
 
 

Home co-ordinates ( 52.47879, -1.471939 )




 for meteor in meteor_data:
    ...:     if not ('reclat' in meteor and 'reclong' in meteor): continue
    ...:     meteor['distance'] = calc_dist(float(meteor['reclat']), float(meteor['reclong']), my_loc[0], my_loc[1])
